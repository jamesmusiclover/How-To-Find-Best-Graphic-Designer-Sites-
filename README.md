<h1>What is a Graphic Designer?</h1>
<p><br>A&nbsp;<a href="https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=381452&brand=fiverrcpa&landingPage=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2Fsearch%2Fgigs%3Fquery%3Dgraphics%2520designer%26source%3Dtop-bar%26search_in%3Deverywhere%26search-autocomplete-original-term%3Dgraphics%2520designer">Graphic Designer</a> is a professional within the graphic design and graphic arts industry who assembles together images, typography, or motion graphics to create a piece of design. A&nbsp;Graphic Designer&nbsp;creates the graphics primarily for published, printed, or electronic media, such as brochures and advertising. They are also sometimes responsible for typesetting, illustration, user interfaces, and web design. A core responsibility of the designer&apos;s job is to present information in a way that is both accessible and memorable</p>

<h2>Visual identity graphic design</h2>
<p>A brand is a relationship between a business or&nbsp;Organization&nbsp;and its audience. A brand identity is how the Organization communicates its personality, tone and essence, as well as memories, emotions and experiences. Visual identity graphic design is exactly that: the visual elements of brand identity that act as the face of a brand to communicate those intangible qualities through images, shapes and color.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Designers&nbsp;that specialize in visual identity graphic design collaborate with brand stakeholders to create assets like logos, typography, color palettes and image libraries that represent a brand&rsquo;s personality. In addition to the standard business cards and corporate stationery, designers often develop a set of visual brand guidelines (style guides) that describe best practices and provide examples of visual branding applied across various media.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Marketing &amp; advertising graphic design</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>When most people think of graphic design, they think of designs created for&nbsp;Marketing and Advertising.&nbsp;Companies depend on successful marketing efforts to tap into their target audience&rsquo;s decision-making process. Great marketing engages people based on the wants, needs, awareness and satisfaction they have about a product, service or brand. Since people will always find visual content more engaging, graphic design helps&nbsp;Organizations&nbsp;promote and communicate more effectively.&nbsp;</p>

They might work alone or as part of an in-house or creative team.&nbsp;Designers&nbsp;can specialize in a specific type of media or create a broad assortment of collateral for print, digital, and beyond. While traditionally print-centered, this type of design has grown to include more digital assets, especially for use in content marketing and digital advertising.</p>
